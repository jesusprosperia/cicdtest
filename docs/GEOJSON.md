## This is the documentation of geojson files used for geographical map visualization.

During dataset upload, users can upload a geojson file for map visualization for segmentation variables.

Geojson structure must be:

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [{
    "type": "Feature",
    "geometry": {
      "type": "Polygon",
      "coordinates": [ [ [100.0, 0.0], [101.0, 0.0], [101.0, 1.0], [100.0, 1.0], [100.0, 0.0] ] ]
    },
    "properties": { "name": "segmentation variable value" }
  }]
}
```

It is a must to match values of `properties.name` to segmentation variables in the uploaded dataset.

System uses `d3-geo` to project and render Geojson onto svg. For projection, system uses `Mercator` projection with `fitSize`.

In general, geojsons uses `Sperical` or `Planar` coordinate conventions. Our system handles both, but for sperical coordinates we need rewinding technique. It is described well on [d3-geo](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo#d3-geo) docs:

"Spherical polygons also require a winding order convention to determine which side of the polygon is the inside: the exterior ring for polygons smaller than a hemisphere must be clockwise, while the exterior ring for polygons larger than a hemisphere must be anticlockwise. Interior rings representing holes must use the opposite winding order of their exterior ring. This winding order convention is also used by TopoJSON and ESRI shapefiles; however, it is the opposite convention of GeoJSONâ€™s RFC 7946. (Also note that standard GeoJSON WGS84 uses planar equirectangular coordinates, not spherical coordinates, and thus may require stitching to remove antimeridian cuts.)"

For geojson rewind, [geojson-rewind](https://github.com/mapbox/geojson-rewind) is used. Using parameter `clockwise = true`, because it is very rare where we need anticlockwise.
